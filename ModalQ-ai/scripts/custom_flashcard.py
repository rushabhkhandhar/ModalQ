# file='''Alcohols are an important class of organic compounds that contain a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom. They are derived from hydrocarbons by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms with hydroxyl groups. Alcohols are widely used in everyday life, from hand sanitizers to fuels.

# The general formula for alcohols is R-OH, where R represents an alkyl group (such as methyl, ethyl, or propyl). The simplest alcohol is methanol (CH3OH), followed by ethanol (C2H5OH), which is commonly known as drinking alcohol.

# Alcohols are classified into three types based on the number of carbon atoms attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group:

# Primary alcohols: The carbon atom with the -OH group is attached to only one other carbon atom.
# Secondary alcohols: The carbon atom with the -OH group is attached to two other carbon atoms.
# Tertiary alcohols: The carbon atom with the -OH group is attached to three other carbon atoms.
# Alcohols have higher boiling points compared to hydrocarbons of similar molecular mass due to hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules. They are generally soluble in water, with solubility decreasing as the length of the carbon chain increases.

# Common reactions of alcohols include:

# Oxidation: Alcohols can be oxidized to form aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids.
# Dehydration: Alcohols can undergo dehydration to form alkenes.
# Esterification: Alcohols react with carboxylic acids to form esters.
# Alcohols have numerous applications in industry and everyday life. Ethanol is used as a solvent, fuel additive, and in alcoholic beverages. Methanol is used in antifreeze and as a fuel. Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a disinfectant and cleaning agent.

# Understanding the properties and reactions of alcohols is crucial for further studies in organic chemistry and biochemistry.'''
